Ghana Ministry of Health (MoH) 2020: COVID-19 Response & Infrastructure Analysis

Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive data analysis of the Ghana Ministry of Health's performance and healthcare capacity in response to the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020. Utilizing data extracted from the MoH 2020 Annual Report, this analysis aims to highlight key metrics across COVID-19 cases, testing, healthcare infrastructure, and human resources.

Key Questions Explored:
What were the key COVID-19 case metrics (total cases, recoveries, deaths) as of early 2021?
What was the capacity of healthcare infrastructure (labs, treatment centers, beds, ventilators)?
How did the testing strategy and positivity rates compare across different surveillance types?
How was the Ministry's staff structured by category, age group, and gender?

Key Findings & Insights

Based on the analysis of the Ghana MoH 2020 Annual Report, some key insights include:

COVID-19 Case Overview: [e.g., As of Jan 18, 2021, Ghana reported 58,431 total cases with a 95.70% recovery rate and a 0.61% Case Fatality Rate (CFR).]
Active Case Distribution: [e.g., Greater Accra significantly contributed to active cases, accounting for 52.90%.]
Testing Strategy: [e.g., Contact tracing efforts yielded a slightly lower positivity rate (9.03%) compared to routine surveillance (10.23%).]
Healthcare Infrastructure: [e.g., The country established 98 treatment and isolation centers with a total bed capacity of 2,002 beds by mid-2020.]
Human Resources: [e.g., Senior staff constitute a significant majority (71.76%) within the MoH, with male staff accounting for 56.74% of the total.]

Project Methodology & Data Pipeline

This project followed a complete data analysis pipeline, from data acquisition to visualization, using a series of steps:

1.  Data Acquisition:** Data was manually extracted from the Ghana Ministry of Health 2020 Annual Report (PDF), with a focus on statistical tables and key figures embedded in the text.
2.  Data Cleaning & Transformation: Unstructured data from the PDF was cleaned, organized, and transformed into structured tables using Microsoft Excel and Power Query Editor in Power BI. This involved handling data types, removing extraneous text, and standardizing headers.
3.  Data Modeling: The cleaned data was imported into Power BI Desktop, where a simple data model was created to prepare the data for analysis.
4.  Data Analysis: Key metrics (e.g., Case Fatality Rate, Recovery Rate, Test Positivity Rate) were calculated, and comparisons were made between different data points to find actionable insights.
